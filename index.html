                        <p>There was something clearly wrong with the drain plug itself. The lever that moved the plug up and down was stuck and would not budge up or down. I removed the faceplate, used a long screwdriver and leverage to slowly work the plug loose. The whole aparateus came out caked in rust and calcium deposits and it needed to be cleaned. I used the same polishing compound that was used on the Moscow Mule copper mugs and it worked like a charm. Returning the plug, it was much more free to move and the tub drained faster!</p>

                        <p>The mount required finding the studs which were 16" apart from one another. I knew there was electric wires in the wall so I had to be careful with drilling through the drywall. Using the mounting template and a stud finder, I marked off the correct location for holes. After mounting the TV, I ran a coaxial cable through the wall to the attic where I connected a digital over-the-air antenna.</p>

                        <p>The table needed to be sanded down, painted white, then coated with a protective layer of Polyurethene. A handheld power sander was used for most of the table. Once prepared, the painting process took 2 days to paint 3 coats of white and 2 coats of Polyurethene using an electric powered paint sprayer.</p>

            <h3>Planned Projects for the Summer</h3>
            <p>The summer is an excellent time to spend fixing up the house. The weather and long days make it perfect for completing project inside and out.</p>
            <p>Renovating the kitchen will be the biggest and most involved project for this summer. For painting the tile backsplash I will use a technique similar to the one explained here:</p>

                </video>
            <p>The next project involves climbing up on the roof and spraying a cleaner mixture of Oxygen Bleach and water across the entire area to remove moss</p>

            <p>Finally, I can consider the summer successful after installing a dog door and ceramic wall heaters.</p>

            <h3>3 Year Wish List</h3>
            <p>There are two long term projects that are within my ability and will add significant value to the home. The current status of the pipes and windows are old, out of date, and inefficient.</p>

                        <figcaption>The current pipes are installed using copper and galvanized steel in the same system. This causes corrosion over time and could lead to leaks and water damage. I'd like to replace the entire plubming system with PEX plastic tubing.</figcaption>

                        <figcaption>The house was built in 1954 and the windows are original, ie. wood frame and single pane. Replacing the exsisting windows using new materials and dual pane technology will increase temperature and sound insulation.</figcaption>
